# DFA.jl: Detrended fluctuation analysis in Julia
=======
## Introduction
The DFA package provides tools to perform a [detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrended_fluctuation_analysis) and estimates the scaling exponent from the results. DFA is used to characterize long memory dependence in stochastic fractal time series.

## Install
To install the package:

`julia> Pkg.clone("git@github.com:afternone/DFA.jl.git")`

## Usage Examples
We'll perform a DFA and estimates the scaling exponent for a random time series.
```
using DFA

x = rand(10000)
n, Fn = dfa(x)
```
You can also specify the following key arguments:

* **order**:  the order of the polynomial fit. Default: `1`.
* **overlap**:  the overlap of blocks in partitioning the time data expressed as a fraction in [
0,1). A positive overlap will slow down the calculations slightly with the (possible)
effect of generating less biased results. Default: `0`.
* **boxmax**: an integer denoting the maximum block size to use in partitioning the data. Default:
`div(length(x), 2)`.
* **boxmin**: an integer denoting the minimum block size to use in partitioning the data. Default: `2*(order+1)`.
* **boxratio**: the ratio of successive boxes. This argument is used as an input to the logScale
function. Default: `2`.

To perform a DFA on x with boxmax=1000, boxmin=4, boxratio=1.2, overlap=0.5:
```
n1, Fn1 = dfa(x, boxmax=1000, boxmin=4, boxratio=1.2, overlap=0.5)
```
To estimates the scaling exponent:
```
intercept, α = polyfit(log10(n1), log10(Fn1))  # α is scaling exponent
```
To plot F(n)~n:
```
using PyPlot

loglog(n1, Fn1, "o")
```
To plot F(n)~n with fitted line:
```
logn1 = log10(n1)
plot(logn1, log10(Fn1), "o", logn1, α.*logn1.+intercept)
```
